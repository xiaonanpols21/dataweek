            <div class="h-txt">
                <p>BTS is a South Korean K-pop boyband. They debuted in 2013. Over the years they’ve worked hard for where they are now. With their music they want to change the world.</p>
                <p>BTS makes their own music. They just don’t make music about only love, sex and drugs. They make music with lyrics which has a meaning. They want to tell you a story; they want to comfort you so that you can love yourself. One of the biggest campaigns that they had was Love Yourself. They wanted you to love yourself. But in those times, they also learned to love themselves.</p>
                <p><b>I didn’t know anything about loving myself. You guys thought me. Please use me. Please use BTS to love yourself</b></p>

                <p>I’ve been a Harry Styles fan since 2011, I’ve followed him since his years in One Direction. Since the start of his solo career, I listen to his music every day. Through Twitter I’m in contact with other “Harries” (the name of his fans). These fans are from all over the world.<b> Harry’s music makes me happy. </b>Next year I will see him 3 times in the Johan Cruijff ArenA. I’m really excited to see him again,<b> I saw Harry live in New York this year, such a unique experience that I will never forget.</b></p>
