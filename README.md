Here is our project for Information Design Dataweek. Read our [Product bio](https://lopsided-guavaberry-72e.notion.site/Dataweek-BTS-vs-Harry-Styles-a24f9728e871422e851b336ae7dcbff3) for further information.

## Who are you?
We are Melissa and Xiao Nan. Vis Trach and Tech Trach. We are students of HvA doing the education CMD. We are doing the ‘themasemester’ Information design

## What are you going to do?
We are making a data visualization about music, BTS and Harry styles. Those two different artists are being placed and compared with each other.

## What is your concept?
Our concept is to make a website (one page) where the 3 subjects are placed from the dataset from [Rapid API Spotify]( https://rapidapi.com/Glavier/api/spotify23/)

* Monthly listeners
* Top tracks
* Top 5 cities who listens the most to the artist


## How can you use your data visualization?
You can scroll to the page to see the different data visualizations. Every section has his own unique style of design where data is shown to the user.
